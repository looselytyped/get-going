# Get Going

This repository contains the code for my "Get Going" talk, presented at the [No Fluff Just Stuff Conference Tour](https://nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main).
It attempts to highlight the various features of the Go language in discrete steps.

Each feature is encapsulated in a separate folder, with a `main.go` file making it easy to run and test.

The `main.go` file found in `000-test` is simply there as a placeholder.
Use this to play with a feature, and then simply do the following:

```sh
> cd /path/to/the/clone
> cd 000-test
> go run main.go
```

## Usage

- You will need Go [installed](https://golang.org/doc/install)
